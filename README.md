# Starbucks_capstone_project
The capstone project is the last step in completing the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree course and I choose to take on the Starbucks challenge.
In this project, I perform Exaplanatoy Data Analysis and predictive modelling on data sets that contain simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
The code will run smoothly with python 3.
## Project motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
In this project, work with data sets that contain simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app to answer the following questions:
1. How does the offer outcome vary with offer information?
2. How does the offer outcome vary with demographics data information?
3. How well does the offer and demographics data explain the outcome of the offer types Discount and BOGO?
## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
There are 3 data files that we work with in this project:
1. Portfolio  - the file contains information abput offer ids and meta data about each offer forexample duration, offer type, among others
2. Profile  - the file contains demographic data for each customer forexample the age, income, gender of the customer among others.
3. Transcript.json - the file contains records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed.

I include markdown cells to define the goal, steps of the code and present summary of the results.
There are in-line comments to further describe some steps in the code.
